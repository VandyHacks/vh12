  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to submit a project?",
    answer: "Not necessarily! While it is highly recommended that you form a team and try to work on a project together to get the full hackathon experience, you can still learn a ton and have a lot of fun just by participating in our events (we worked hard on them)!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I submit older projects?",

  },
  {
    question: "Am I eligible to win a prize?",

  },
  {
    question: "What if I have never been to a hackathon?",
    answer: "Don't fret! You will receive a full guide on how to hack a few days before the event, and there will also be VandyHacks staff, mentors, and other hackers to answer any questions you might have."
  },
  {
    question: "How are teams formed?",
    answer: "You can form teams with friends or reach out on our Discord before the event starts. We will also have an event right after the opening ceremony specifically for team matching. A team can have at most four people. You also don't need a team to submit a project, feel free to work individually!"
  },
  {
    question: "Will there be other activities?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Our committee has been working very hard on creating the best workshops, career fairs (with sponsors!), social events, panels, and so much more! To be eligible to participate in most events, you need to register, even if you don't plan on submitting a project."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I participate virtually?",
    answer: "Unfortunately not, VandyHacks XII is fully in-person."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring?",
